# Decentralized Parametric Flood Insurance

A blockchain-based solution for automated, transparent flood insurance that pays out immediately when predefined conditions are met.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized parametric flood insurance platform that eliminates traditional claims processes through automated verification and payout systems. By leveraging blockchain technology and IoT sensor data, we create a trustless insurance model that provides immediate financial relief to policyholders affected by flooding events.

## Core Components

### Policy Issuance Contract
- Defines coverage parameters, terms, and conditions
- Establishes premium calculations based on risk assessment
- Issues digital policy tokens representing coverage
- Manages policy expiration and renewal processes
- Implements regulatory compliance checks and reporting

### Water Level Monitoring Contract
- Integrates with decentralized network of flood sensors and weather stations
- Securely collects and validates water level measurements
- Maintains tamper-proof record of historical flood data
- Implements consensus mechanisms for data accuracy verification
- Supports multiple data sources including satellite imagery and government monitoring stations

### Automated Claims Contract
- Executes immediate payouts when predefined thresholds are triggered
- Processes claims without requiring manual intervention
- Implements graduated payout scales based on flood severity
- Verifies triggering events through multiple data sources
- Creates transparent audit trail of all claims and payments

### Risk Pool Management Contract
- Handles collection and allocation of premium payments
- Manages insurance reserves and liquidity requirements
- Implements reinsurance mechanisms for catastrophic events
- Calculates dynamic risk assessments based on historical data
- Provides transparent accounting of fund allocation and utilization
